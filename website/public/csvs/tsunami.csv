Atlantic Ocean. This is a relatively large magnitude offshore earthquake which was registered on the tide gauge at Lome. (reference #1214)
<P>1933, May 19. ... At Accra, a town of approximately 77,000 people, 16 persons were killed and 133 were injured by the earthquake, which caused great alarm to Africans and Europeans alike. It was accompanied by a loud and sustained rumbling and by a violent shaking of the ground which lasted for fully 10 seconds. Many of those indoors,
particularly those upstairs in two-storey buildings, found it very difficult to walk, and children and invalids were knocked over. The majority of people who were indoors at the time ran outside but some Africans not knowing what was happening rushed indoors. The sea is said to have become rough and fishermen at Labadi and Teshi, who were in their canoes at the time, say that their canoes shivered and that they lost control of them for a time. Fortunately, none of the canoes was overturned. These fishermen say that immediately before the earthquake a light flashed across the sky and dropped into the sea. Other observers mentioned the occurrence of lightning and shooting stars (meteorites).
<P>For a short period after, the main shock a faint smell was noticeable. It was described by one observer as a stale marshy smell and by another as a slightly sulphurous smell. This was probably caused by the discharge into the atmosphere of sulphuretted hydrogen from the mud in the lagoons near Accra...
<P>Reliable evidence obtained from fishermen at sea at the time of the earthquake is not abundant, owing chiefly to the time at which the earthquake occurred. It appears, however, that the sea was not disturbed noticeably along most af the coast. Between Accra and Fete it was reported that canoes were shaken, the fishermen comparing the shake with the shivering of a very cold person. The sea
remained calm. Further east, however, at Labadi and Teshi, the sea is said to have become rough and to have roared loudly for a few minutes. Fishermen were alarmed and cried out for help. The bump of the earthquake waves was felt on a few passenger and cargo ships at sea or in pont, but no
damage was done. The waters of the Sakumo and Kako lagoons are said to have been thrown up, to fall again with a splash, while water spurted from the sand vents as from a fountain. (reference #1077)"

was observed on 7 May 2007 on the Bulgarian Black Sea
coast. The maximum wave amplitude was three meters, and
the sea oscillations lasted for several hours. The anomalous
behaviour was seen in many places of the coast of Bulgaria
and was stronger in the north. Several accounts of
eyewitnesses as well as reports of local port authorities
and three tide-gauge recordings are available and have been
collected and analysed. The tsunami could have been
produced by a submarine landslide or by atmospheric
pressure pulses. Here, we explore the former hypothesis,
i.e., the possibility that the tsunami was induced by a
landslide that may have occurred on the shelf margin off
Bulgaria. By making use of numerical modelling we find
that submarine mass movements taking place within a
certain delimited source area off Bulgaria may have
generated tsunamis compatible with the observations... The anomalous behaviour of the sea started around 9:00Â–9:30 am (Local Time) on 7 May 2007 and lasted with progressive attenuation for about 5 hours. Direct observations were made mostly in the two biggest towns of the coast - Balchik and Kavarna (about 13000 inhabitants each). The port authorities reported similar effects to the north, near Kaliakra cape and the village of Shabla. Slightly more to the south, the observations were documented by observers at the Varna port and the Galata oil and gas platform. The oscillations were recorded by two sea level analogue mareographs, one in Varna and one in Ahtopol (the southernmost point of the Bulgarian Black Sea coast) operated by NIGiF (Scientific Research for Geodesy and Photogrammetry, Sofia).
<P>The tsunami caused only slight damage in the affected
areas. In Kavarna, a 25Â–30 ton tourist boat was rotated
violently according to his captain and was damaged near the
anchor holes and in some other parts, including the rudder.
Many small fishing boats were cast onto the beach in

In this paper we review the potential causes for this landslide based on an integrated study of eye witness testimony, swath bathymetry data and stability analyses. Results show that the Sokkelvik landslide was most likely triggered by intense rainfall and snowmelt, but that the main cause is associated to the load of an up to 7.5 m high embankment fill. This fill was placed at the shoreline for road construction 6 months before the landslide. Results presented herein show the importance of accounting for extreme rainfall events and groundwater flow when planning construction activity in sensitive near shore areas. (reference #11863)"

In the year 1821, I was a midshipman in his majesty's ship Vigo, guard-ship at St. Helena, bearing the flag of Rear-Admiral Lambert, and commanded by Cap. Thomas Brown, during the latter period of Napoleon's exile. I had charge of an excellent establishment on shore, called the stockyard, for keeping a supply of fat cattle for the squadron after its arrival from the Cape, lank and lean. My party of men always slept on board, landing the next morning at daylight. It was in the early part of May, a month rendered remarkable by the death of the great chieftain, which took place on the 5th day, that we were pulling in as usual the launch, with several working parties on board, but observing that the surf was too violent for the large boat filled with men, to attempt a landing, we tried to accomplish it by a few at a time, in the jolly boat. A small number, including myself, got on shore in this manner. Shortly after I was engaged in conversation with an officer of the Hon. Company's ship Ganges, surrounded by native women, some children, and Lascars, when I felt myself forcibly pulled by the arm, and heard a person exclaim--""Look at the horizon, run, save yourself, we shall all be lost!"" I did look, and the sight I shall never cease to remember, it was so frightfully grand. On the horizon, from the north-west, appeared an immense undulation, or swell, resembling a bank of water rolling majestically in, directly in the wind's eye. Whether it was my anxiety for the boats, or that astonishment had paralyzed me, I cannot tell, but I felt riveted to the spot alone, and before I could attempt to save myself, as others did, by climbing the rocks I was whirled along with the rapidity of lightning, in the midst of this dark wave.
<P>""Almost in an instant I experienced a violent shock, which stunned me for a few moments; on recovering the perfect use of my senses, I found myself in the armourer's cave, with the forge lying across my thigh. To this circumstance I must draw attention, as, by its weight keeping me from going into the sea as the water receded, and from being dashed against the rocks, to it I owe my preservation. Near me were lying two Lascars, one was split up the middle, the other's skull was beat to pieces--<B>both were dead</B>. Fearing a return of the surf, as the sea usually runs in quickly twice, and then comes with redoubled violence, I made the best use of my lungs; the carpenter fortunately heard my cries, and rescued me. My clothes were torn to shreds, my ears, eyes, and nose, filled with ashes and blood; but with the exception of a few contusions, and lacerated hands, I was otherwise unhurt. <B>One woman was drowned</B>, and several men and children were picked up by the boats.
<P>""This first swell that I have mentioned was the prelude to a gigantic surf, which lasted three days. This phenomenon (as nothing like it had ever taken place in the memory of the oldest inhabitants) was attributed to an <B>earthquake</B>. We had only telegraphic communication with the ship while it lasted. The fortifications were much injured in front of St. James Town; huge rocks were torn up and tossed into our little bathing place to the left of the landing; the guard-house was abandoned the sea reaching the upper windows; the ships rode with sails aback, to keep them astern of their anchors; and, while it lasted, to see the mass of water burst upon the cliffs, as if to shake the island from its foundation, was the grandest sight I ever beheld.""<P>(above from reference #4222)"

According to the description, the wave impacted the Levantine coast with effects recorded at Caesarea and Yavne. The tsunami was 1ike1y caused by a powerfu1 earthquake that destroyed
the city of Antioch (Ambraseys and Jackson, 1998) and
originated somewhere a10ng the eastern Cyprean Arc (Ben-Avraham et al., 1995). The construction of Caesarea's harbor by Herod the Great in 21 B.e. is well documented by excavation work and descriptions of the harbor by the historian Josephus Flavius (Whiston, 1999; Holum et al.,
1988). The reasons for the rapid dec1ine in the harbor, about one century 1ater, are 1ess c1ear, and heavily debated (Reinhardt and Raban, 1999; Hoh1felder, 2000). However, the favored interpretation has been the catastrophic destruction of the harbor by an earthquake; although the role of a tsunami has been considered, no conc1usive evidence has ever been found (Raban, 1992, 1999; Reinhardt and Raban, 1999; Mart and Perecman, 1996).

At the latitude of the earthquake of September 29, 2009, the Pacific plate moves westward with respect to the interior of the Australia plate at a velocity of about 86 mm/year. The earthquake occurred near the northern end of a 3,000 km long segment of the Pacific/Australia plate boundary that trends north-northeast; farther north of the earthquakeÂ’s source region, the plate boundary trends northwest and then west. The eastern edge of the broad Australia plate may be viewed as a collection of small plates or microplates that move with respect to each other and with respect to the Pacific plate and the Australia plate interior.
<P>On the basis of currently available location and fault mechanism information, we infer that the September 29 earthquake occurred as a normal fault rupture on or near the outer rise of the subducting Pacific plate.
<P>The broad-scale Australia/Pacific plate boundary is one of the most active earthquake regions in the world. Earthquakes occur on the thrust-fault boundary between the Australia and Pacific plates, within the Pacific plate on both sides of the trench, and within and on the boundaries of the small plates that compose the eastern edge of the overall Australia plate.

'The water swept aside everything that got in its way,' said a resident of the small town of Boyecura. A wall of water swept across the Chilean island of Robinson Crusoe, 670 km off the coast, destroying many buildings and sweeping 5 people out to sea. Eleven others were missing. The Chilean Navy admitted it failed to give adequate tsunami warning to Robinson Crusoe, which lies in the Chilean archipelago of Juan Fernandez.

And then officials started waiting for information about a possible tsunami, but it ever came. Instead, as they saw the sea starting to rise, they rushed to switch on the sirens - but it was too late for some. The tsunami killed 5 people on the island, while 14 remained missing a day later, a toll that may have been avoided had the tsunami-detection and warning mechanisms been in order, some say. Upon hearing the sirens, some of the 629 residents of the village of Juan Bautista on Robinson Crusoe Is ran to the hills with no time for salvage. A wall of water - possibly nearly 5 metres high - ravaged everything in its way. Within a few minutes, the scene of the adventures of Scottish sailor Alexander Selkirk - marooned on the island from 1704 to 1708, and immortalized in Daniel Defoe's novel Robinson Crusoe - had been razed to the ground. ""Everything that had been along that three-km stretch just disappeared,"" said Fernando Avaria, the first pilot to fly over the area after the disaster. The cemetery, the churches, sports facilities and the area's only school were reduced to planks of wood and broken glass. The buildings of the local authority simply disappeared. ""It was devastating, really out of a horror film,"" said Margot Salas, a local who toured the area with Chilean state television cameras almost 24 hours after the disaster.

The eruption of October 25 has been definitely located in the region of the vapors, and it is the theory of Guatemalan scientists that the earthquake of April 18 cracked the under side of the mountain to a depth below the sea level, permitting the flow of water upon the dormant lava of the volcano. The subsequent earthquakes were, in his opinion, the result of interior explosions of the steam thus generated, and the final eruption that has devastated the Santa Maria region is ascribed to a last gigantic effort of this imprisoned vapor to burst its fetters. On September 27 a tidal wave rolled in upon the coast of
Guatemala, concentrating upon the shore at Ocos, north of Champerico, where it destroyed the pier and washed away the beach, tearing the ocean bed to a depth of seven fathoms, where the lead had previously sounded only five fathoms. The course of the river at Ocos was diverted, and now flows into the harbor close to the town, a considerable distance from its original point of entrance. (reference #7815)"

<P>The Mw 7.8 Mentawai earthquake of 25 October 2010 was a tsunami earthquake. It occurred seaward of the southern
Mentawai islands of Sumatra, Indonesia, and preceded a very large tsunami that caused substantial damage and 509 deaths [casualty information from Pusdalops PB Sumbar (the Disaster Management Operational Control Center for West Sumatra Province)]. Maximum measured tsunami runup was >16 m. Seismological solutions indicate a shallow dip, consistent with an origin on the Sunda megathrust... Along the west coast of the Mentawai Islands, from southern Siberut to the southern tip of South Pagai Island, tsunami heights generally ranged from 1 to 10 m with the strongest effects observed along the west coasts of North and South Pagai islands. Maximum tsunami heights were measured along the western shores of a string of small islands west of South Pagai. On one of these islands, Sibigau, we recorded a maximum runup of 16.9 m, with similar measurements of 12.6, 14.8 and 10.2 m recorded at locations nearby. It should be noted that these values are measurements of true runup height, i.e., the situation where the tsunami wave reaches a maximum elevation against topographical relief.(reference #10265)

Lobster boats spun like tops. Large lobster cars flipped over or started to drift out to sea... At around noon Tuesday, fishermen in Corea noticed unusual weather conditions: Tides seemed abnormally high, winds pounded the area, and daylight seemed to dim, then brighten again. They had just experienced what Raymond Dunbar Jr. defined as a ""bore tide"" -- a 5- to 6-foot-high wall of water. Dunbar, who was watching the storm... said he saw the tide's effect on Bruce Crowley's boat. ""It had horsed up around another one,"" he said. He saw the boat disappear. ""By that time the tide had bore out again, and she (Crowley's boat) went down out of sight and it made me think more that she had parted her mooring."" Dwight Rodgers, manager of the Corea Co-op, said Wednesday that the tidal action was spectacular. ""There was a lot of water in the harbor and, as if somebody opened a drain, the water just disappeared,"" he said. The tidal bore created a whirlpool effect that caused some of the nearly 30 boats moored in the harbor to whip around each other. Harvey Crowley... could not believe what he saw. ""Boats were all snarled up, lobster cars were out in the middle of the harbor upside down,"" he said...  The tidal action caused one lobster car filled with lobsters to drag its two moorings. A 22-by-14-foot lobster car belonging to Dunbar's son flipped over...  Lobsterman Bruce Crowley said he noticed a difference in the tide as he watched it from his home near Corea Harbor. ""I saw the water all go out, just for a minute. It was up one minute and it was gone the next. It went fast,"" he said. Dunbar said he watched as Bruce Crowley's lobster car broke loose, headed out to sea, and then was pushed back into the harbor by a large wave. ""When that lobster car came in the second time, you couldn't row a dinghy fast enough to keep up with it. That was how fast it came up with the tide. ... It was scary,"" he said. Babe Crowley, whose home overlooks the harbor, said the tidal surge was unlike anything he had seen in his 63 years. He estimated that the wind gusted to about 80 miles per hour... (reference #9221)
<P>Geologist explains tidal phenomenon at Corea Harbor, Bangor Daily News, January 7, 1994. Joe Kelley, director of marine geology for the Maine Geological Survey, who is based at the University of Maine, said... ""What was described in that article certainly was unusual for any area. To have water leave a harbor suddenly and then come back in suddenly as a large wave is not usual. It takes a lot of force to move water, and while there was a storm going on, that probably wasn't all of it,""... Kelley said he had ruled out several causes. He said the event was not a tidal bore because the tides were not right. He also ruled out the possibility that the event was a tsunami... Tsunamis are related to earthquakes and a call to the Weston Geophysical Observatory in Weston, Mass., Kelley said, revealed there had been no earthquake in the North Atlantic area. The U.S. Weather Service, Kelley said, had reported that just before noon, the atmospheric pressure in Providence, R.I. dropped severely... The geologist said he believed the disturbance at Corea Harbor may have been caused by methane gas escaping from the ocean's mud bottom. He said that several years ago he had explored several methane-related holes in the sea floor in Belfast Bay [Maine]... ""What I think happened is a sudden change in the pressure raises the water level that loads the ocean floor, squeezes a bubble of (methane) gas which pushes water out and causes a wave to come into the harbor. The bubble breaks, and the water rushes back out to fill the void,"" he said. Kelly said the event apparently repeated itself several times. (reference #9220)"

Berninghausen, citing Heck, Milne and Montessus de Ballore lists tsunamis accompanying a quake Aug. 19 at Ica and Arica and a quake (quakes? ) on Aug. 20 and 24 at Tacna, Arica, Iquique, and Pica. Heck lists the same tsunami, not clarifying that the places were those at which the quakes, and not necessarily waves, were observed, citing Milne. Milne listed a quake at Arica and Ica on 19 Aug., accompanied by sea waves, citing an unidentified Montessus de Ballore report, and quakes Aug. 20-24 strongest at Arica, Iquique, and Pica, of which one at least was accompanied by sea waves, citing Fuchs, Montessus de Ballore, and Hope-Jones. Rudolph initially (1887) reported a quake at Tacna on Aug. 24 at 13:10 with which was associated the tsunami behavior at Pisagua noted above. Later, however, he quoted a ship captain's report from Pisagua on the same date that ""..the inhabitants cleared out to the mountains leaving another sea wave."" The earlier tsunami thus implied might have occurred on one of the earlier dates shown in Aug. 1869 or might easily have been the tsunami of 1868 Aug. 13. Montessus de Ballore included in his provisional lists (1910-llb) a quake at Arica and Ica on Aug. 19 that was accompanied by a tsunami, but later (19lla) in detailed account omitted this date and described a Peru-N. Chile quake on Aug. 24 accompanied by a tsunami at Arica and Iquique. Fuchs (1870) mentions a tsunami only on Aug. 24 accompanying a quake at Iquique and Arica.

<P>Underwater landslide likely cause of 'mild tsunami', 29 June 2011 Last updated at 06:33 ET. BBC News article. A ""mild tsunami"" along the South West coast was probably caused by an underwater landslide, a coastal expert has said. The unusual tidal surge struck the Cornwall, Devon, Dorset and Hampshire coastline on Monday morning. There were reports of rivers changing direction, fish leaping out of water and hair standing on end due to static... Roland Stewart from Millbrook, near Plymouth, said: ""It was quite violent in a way, my dinghy was moving around with the movement of the water and I just wondered what the hell was going on.... within 15 minutes it was all over."".. Dr Davidson, an associate professor in coastal processes, told BBC Spotlight: ""[Surges] are quite rare and it's probably not a tidal phenomenon. ""It's probably more likely to be a tsunami of some kind, obviously it's quite mild. ""It's probably not due to an earthquake, which is the normal source. ""It's probably more likely to be a sub-marine landslide."" According to the Tidal Gauge Anomaly measure, which records the difference between the forecast tide and the actual tide, the anomaly on Monday morning in Newlyn, Cornwall was 0.2m (0.7ft), in Plymouth 0.3m (1ft) and in Portsmouth 0.4m (1.3ft). The MET Office in Exeter said it did not think anything in the weather could have caused the change in the tidal pattern. The British Geological Survey said there was no seismic activity in UK waters over the weekend. (reference #9478)"

<P>1897 October. The bibliography on tsunamis (Annotated bibliography..., 1964, No. 816) makes a reference to the following description. ""A telegram from Manila on November 2nd, 1897, received at Victoria (Hong Kong) says that a tsunami fell on the coast of the Philippine Islands.
A strong wave crossed the San Juanico Strait. The water overflowed and damaged Tacloban. There were victims. Dams were destroyed at Granborengal. The source was apparently situated at open sea (Anon., 1897 a).
<P>[One can assume that this tsunami was formed as the result of the  earthquake of 19.X a 8:00 (Richter, 1963; 18.X, 23h48m; 12<sup>o</sup> N., 126<sup>o</sup> E.; M=8.1), which reached 9 degrees (X Rossi-Forel) on the eastern part of Samar Island. It caused considerable destruction at Sulat, Palapag, Catubig, Oras, Gandara, and 
Laoang, and caused numerous cracks in the ground. Strong tremors were felt at Catbalogan, on Biliran Island, at Tacloban and moderate or strong oscillations were felt in the region of Albay Bay, at Sorsogon, Tabaco, Daet, Ginaiangan, Seber, and Iloilo. The area of the tremors, which included the southeast of Luzon Island, the Visayan Sea and the north of Mindanao Island, measured 800 x 600 km. Numerous recurrent shocks were registered including one 15 minutes after the main earthquake with a maximal intensity of 8 degrees (Maso, 1908 c, 1910 a; Repetti, 1946).
<P><B>In other words, the earthquake had many of the usual signs of tsunamigenicity. There were no other strong earthquakes in the Tacloban region in 1897.

A check for a filed death certificate at the Dept. of Vital Statistics in Victoria reveals a man was indeed lost in the sea in the period March 28-30, 1963 but reported missing near Jedway, BC which is on the inside southern tip of Moresby I. just north of Cape St. James.<P>An interview with Mr. Edward Hartt of the Canadian Coast Guard at Seal Cove near Prince Rupert confirmed the early morning arrival of this approximately 5.5 m high wave (over the tide) at Langara Lighthouse where he was the lightkeeper at the time.

The report of minor damage at Port Simpson by VonHake and Cloud was not confirmed in the interviews of Port Simpson residents by the author. It is unfortunate that the lightkeepers records from other lighthouses nearer to Port Simpson during this period (March 1963) are no longer available to confirm any closer sightings of this unusual wave to Port Simpson. According to Mr. Ed. Hartt these records were destroyed when the coast Guard moved their offices from Prince Rupert to Seal Cove in 1972...<P>Stephenson [2003] resumes the information on this event as follows:<br>-If there was a tsunami, it was a local event generated by an underwater slump.<br>-This tsunami event was almost certainly smaller than any of the ""reported"" heights. From the report by Willie Rapatz it follows that the dislodged tanks were only about 0.3 m above the high water (HW) line, and the road which logs washed up onto was only about 1.2 m above the HW line.<br>-The reported 10 and 12 m waves were probably heights above chart datum, meaning that the maximum wave height was about 5.5 m.<P>(above from reference #4153)<P>1963, March 30/31.

<P>On 26 August 2012 at 10:37 p.m. local time (27 August 2012, 0437 UTC), an earthquake with Mw 7.3 (W-phase) occurred off the coast of El Salvador and Nicaragua. The epicenter, as reported by the US Geological Survey (USGS), was located approximately 75 km due south of the El Salvador coastline (Fig. 1). Approximately 50 aftershocks with magnitudes between 5.5 and 4.2 occurred in the vicinity of the main event between 27 August and 11 September 2012. The initial assessment of the earthquake by the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC) determined that the earthquake was significant due to the strength of the seismic signal and the long-period nature of the initial seismic waves. Within 10 min of the main shock, additional analysis by the PTWC suggested that the earthquake could be characterized as a Â‘slowÂ’ earthquake.
<P>The strongest tsunami effects were experienced along the central section of the San Juan del Gozo Peninsula. At the time of the earthquake (*10:37 p.m.) it was relatively dark with a quarter moon low over the horizon and a moonset near 1 a.m. The earthquake occurred just after high tide when scores of people were present on the beach collecting sea turtle eggs for conservation projects. A worker at one of the hatcheries was in a ramada (a small shed with wooden posts, and walls and roof made from aluminum siding) located on the beach at the crest of the dunes approximately 70 m from the water when the earthquake occurred. This witness came out of the ramada when he heard people crying out and was subsequently caught in the wave and dragged some 90 m inland where he was ultimately suspended in a tree branch at a height of 2.1 m above the ground. This witness reported that there were three tsunami waves and that the flow depth at the ramada was just below the roof (approx. 2.5 m). During the tsunami, the walls of the ramada were torn off of the posts that are deeply embedded in the sand; the posts themselves were not pulled out of the ground, but some were pushed over by the force of the water. Other witnesses related similar stories, and in total there were more than 40 injured people, with three injuries requiring medical attention."

It has been there since 1740 and now is GreenlandÂ’s most popular tourist destination thanks to the gorgeous Ilulissat Icefjord (tourism is the townÂ’s principal industry). All of which brings us to Jens Muller who is a Greenland native but from another community.
He recently posted a most interesting video of an event that happened on a beautiful, sunny day in Greenland; an event that easily could have cost him and two others their lives. Jens picks it up from there. Â“A tourist from Australia came to my uncle and asked if she could get a ride to the glacier just north of Ilulissat, Greenland, so he asked me if I wanted to be his translator. I am from another town where glaciers are fairy tales, I was as much of a tourist as the Australian tourist, so I decided to join the crew. The beautiful scenery was amazing, but the nature doesn't care about anyone. That day almost became our last day.Â” So it was Jens, his uncle and the Australian tourist in the small boat that drove out to the big glacier that everyone wants to see. The glacier flows at a rate of 65 to 115 feet per day, resulting in around 20 billion tons of icebergs calving off and passing out of the fjord every year. Icebergs breaking from the glacier are often so large (up to 3,300 feet in height) that they are too tall to float down the fjord and instead lay stuck on the bottom of its shallower areas, sometimes for years, until they are broken up by the force of the glacier and icebergs further up the fjord. As Jens was filming the glacier and the beauty of the surroundings, that is when it happened. A massive portion of the glacier calved off and dropped into the sea; a big enough piece that it generated a huge wave.

It rose out of the sea at a spot located about 350 feet (100 m) from the coast, he said...  A mud volcano is a likely possibility because Gwadar's coastline already has several of the gurgling, steamy cones, both onshore and at sea... And in 1945, the magnitude-8.1 Makran temblor triggered the formation of mud volcanoes offshore of Gwadar, according to a study on mud volcanoes in Pakistan published in 2005. A recent study in the journal Nature Geoscience also suggests the 1945 earthquake released tons of methane from the seafloor...But Geologist Dave Petley, a landslide expert, thinks the island's low, arcuate (or bow) shape Â— as seen in the few pictures released so far Â— suggests a rotational landslide, rather than a conical mud volcano.(reference #10751)

The 1947 March 25 (UT) MW7.0-7.1 MS7.2 ML5.9 earthquake (q.v.), centred about 60-70 km offshore was felt with an intensity of MM4 in Gisborne and was the maximum elsewhere along the coast, while the tsunami had maximum water level close to the shore at Gisborne port of about 1.5-1.8 m, consisted of several large waves and a number of smaller waves over several hours, the first of which arrived about 30-40 minutes after the earthquake. The 1880 tsunami would have similarly occurred close to the time of high tide (as calculated by NIWA Tide Forecaster).

<P>Source and exact year unknown but between 1927-28.
Sometime after the beginning of construction of the Tolaga Bay wharf, a long structure reaching hundreds of metres into Tolaga Bay, three large waves, referred to at the time as tidal waves, severely damaged the structure when just five piles had been driven and were in the process of being secured. The waves were noted to be of unusual size, their crests reaching to the deck level, which was 3.3 m above the high water springs mark. The waves were only noted to have damaged the wharf and nothing is noted of their effect on the nearby shore, or anywhere else along the coast.  
No source is known for the large waves that damaged the wharf or the exact date on which the waves occurred, so association with distant/offshore meteorological conditions or with a local or distant earthquake is unknown. Locally, it was noted that there was a moderate easterly breeze, which only slightly roughened the sea. A large local earthquake can be excluded, and as the waves seem to have impacted at Tolaga Bay only and there are no events on the NGDC site that are large enough, a distance source can also be excluded. De Lange & Fraser (1999) suggest a similar source to the March and May 1947 tsunamis (q.v.), which de Lange (1997) proposed were caused by marl diapirism. De Lange & Moon (2004) have since proposed a landslide mechanism. However, the 1947 earthquakes have now been shown to exhibit many source and tsunami characteristics associated with Â‘tsunami earthquakesÂ’ (Downes et al., 2001; Doser & Webb, 2003).
Considering the possibility that the source of the waves in 1926-28 may be an earthquake, including mildly felt earthquakes like the 1947 events, the Poverty Bay Herald has been searched for a few days following known earthquakes in 1926-27, without finding any accounts of the damage to the wharf. However, the earthquake file is probably incomplete for this era.  Although a day-to-day check of the newspapers is probably warranted, it is problematic that the waves that damaged the Tolaga Bay wharf do not seem to have impacted elsewhere on the coast, noting the March 1947 event was observed along 120 km of coastline and the May 1947 tsunami along 80 km of coastline. Given this, and until such time as more evidence of a tectonically generated tsunami can be found, a few rogue waves or a localised meteo-tsunami seem to be the most probable causes of the waves, although one would expect a longer series of waves in the latter case and greater impact on the nearby shore.
In contrast to Fraser (1998), who assigns a reliability of 1 (=certain tsunami) a validity of 2 (questionable, unlikely) following the NGDC classification is assigned."

At Charleston, a vessel was reportedly driven up onto the beach and at Hokitika, 120 km south of Westport, another boat was washed away. However, no report of exceptional currents or water levels has been found in the Hokitika newspaper (West Coast Times), although there is a report of a Harbour Board boat being found unsecured and floating some way offshore on the morning of 3 March.

<P>The Wairarapa Daily was searched without success for any further information until 19 Apr 1882. No other location reported feeling an earthquake nor experiencing a tsunami on this date. However, there was a strong earthquake causing some chimney damage in Taranaki seven days previous, on 6 April, at the same time (note that this event is not yet in NZ National Earthquake Information Catalogue), and there may be some confusion. Being on the west coast of the North Island, it would not have caused a tsunami at Glenburn on the East Coast. Further, the earthquake does not appear to have been large enough to initiate seiching, nor strong enough locally to trigger a submarine landslide. 
<P>According to NIWA tide forecaster, high tide would have been about 1830 on 13 Apr 1882, ie it was mid-tide, or mean sea-level, at 4 pm rather than low water as indicated in the account. However, it is possible that the water had receded prior to the observerÂ’s noticing it.  From mean sea level to over high tide is about 1-1.2 m.  Spring tides occurred 5-8 days later, ie this is unlikely to cause confusion re the proper level of the tides. 
<P>An 6 April, when the Taranaki earthquake occurred, the time of low tide at Glenburn does not coincide with the observation either.

The vessel was eventually repaired and got off, but the anchors and mooring chains were buried under seven feet of sand and the crew had to dig them out."" Assuming that the sailors of the time were completely familiar with tide times, local tidal eccentricities and vagaries of the weather, it is difficult to find an explanation for the quite damaging effects given here.

Fifty four of the 56 people in the village were killed in the landslide, which flowed into the lake carrying trees with it. 
The site was devastated again and many killed by a landslide from the same source in 1910 March 20 (q.v.). On that occasion, a tsunami occurred in the lake, the surges being large enough to cause problems for some children in the water on the opposite shore (Motutere?). 
While no waves or surges are mentioned in the account of the 1846 event, a taniwa [taniwha] is, i.e. Â“The natives say that afterwards the Taniwa fled across the lake to Motutere and thence to Waikato, whence he will go to the sea and perish there; they shall be no more troubled with him; they saw the splash of his tail as lie crossed the lakeÂ” (New Zealand Spectator & Cook's Strait Guardian 1 July 1846).  According to King et al. (2007), events involving large waves, storm surges and tsunamis were commonly explained as the work of taniwha in Maori traditional stories. In light of this, it is likely that the taniwha in the lake after the landslide in 1846 represents a tsunami. 
The occurrence of a tsunami is given a validity of 3 (probable).
Interestingly, the account indicates another landslide 10 years before 1846, before organised European settlement.  (reference #5324)"

It was supposedly observed by two ships, the Pretty Jane and the SS Go Ahead, which were respectively off East Cape and Waipiro Bay (historically known as Open Bay). However, it is probable that some confusion has occurred with the names of the ships, and they were in fact the same ship.
The disturbance, which was less than 400 m across, was visible in front of the ship and to seaward and was moving towards the ship faster than it could steam.  The main disturbance was successfully avoided. Nevertheless the ship was tossed and pitched about until it reached smooth water. 
Newspaper accounts note that a slight earthquake was felt in Gisborne about 12-24 hours previously. Gregg (1958), in analysing the reports, suggests the disturbance was Â“a tsunami resulting from submarine landslides or faulting connected with the earthquake felt at GisborneÂ”. There are no accounts of a tsunami reaching the coast in newspapers of the day. While earthquake faulting could cause such a disturbance, the earthquakeÂ’s occurrence is too early and almost certainly too small, although it may have acted as a trigger. A more plausible explanation is a small submarine landslide, or an expulsive gas emission.
The event is given a validity of 2, as it is possible that a small tsunami was generated, but the source was too small and too localised for the tsunami to reach land at an observable height. The event is primarily recorded in the database to document the occurrence of localised disturbances at sea which may have been caused by gas hydrate emission, the larger events of this sort having been identified as possible tsunami generators.

5552,2008,,,,,-38.7,178,"POVERTY BAY, NORTH ISLAND",NEW ZEALAND,"E Coast Australia, New Zealand, South Pacific Is.",Earthquake,Probable Tsunami,,,,,,,https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/hazel/view/hazards/tsunami/event-more-info/5552,"1831-1834. Burns (1859) records the following: ""One morning I was strolling along the beautiful beach in Poverty Bay, admiring the rising sun ... I had not proceeded far before I felt a powerful shock of the earthquake which nearly took me off my feet, rocking the trees to and fro and causing an immense swell in the sea. I knew perfectly well, from experience, that it was not an earthquake, but an electric shock caused by the eruption of a volcano or burning mountain, about 40 miles in the interior of the country; an occurrence not infrequent in those parts ..."". 
Despite Burns associating the shock with an eruption, his account clearly describes an earthquake, with an intensity of at least MM6-MM7. His association of the earthquake with the Â“immense swell of the seaÂ” suggests the two events occurred within short space of time, indicating a local source or seiching caused by surface waves from a more distant large (M>7.5) earthquake. However, seiching is unlikely to occur on the open coast, except within in a confined harbour or estuary, unlikely to be more than a metre and unlikely to initiate the comment Â“immense swellÂ”. This suggests a local earthquake source within a short tsunami travel time (< 30 minutes), perhaps 50 km from Gisborne. 
Given that ""tsunami earthquakes"" like the 1947 March and May events (q.v.), which caused only mild shaking, have occurred on this part of the coast, determining an appropriate magnitude for an earthquake large enough to cause a tsunami and close enough for it to arrive within a short time, but only large enough to cause moderate intensities is problematic. However, a large strong shaking plate interface earthquake (magnitude greater than 8 with maximum shaking intensities of MM8 and larger) is not indicated. 
According to the Dictionary of New Zealand Biography Vol 1, Burns first came to NZ about 1830. A short time after February 1831 he returned to NZ as a trader at or near Mahia. Early in 1832 he moved to inland Poverty Bay, remained a few months only, and then moved to Tolaga Bay where he remained until October 1834, when he permanently left NZ. This indicates the earthquake occurred between 1831 and 1834, not 1832-38 as suggested by Grouden (1966) and later publications based on this data. The date range is not restricted to the time Burns was in Poverty Bay (a few months in 1832) as he may have travelled on occasions to Poverty Bay from Mahia or Tolaga Bay.

1601, September 18. On 18 September 1601, central Switzerland was hit by one of the largest known earthquakes in central Europe (I = VII-VIII, Mw - 6.2; Swiss Seismological Service, 2002). Several towers in Lucerne were destroyed, and Renward Cysat, the registrar of Lucerne at that time, reported in his chronicle, ""What scared people most was that the out flowing river Reuss flowed back into Lake Lucerne so that the riverbed between the two parts of the city almost became dry and several people
could cross it by foot, before the water again vehemently advanced towards the city"" (Cysat, 1601, p. 884). As Cysat traveled along the lake's shore, he recorded observations such as: ""Ships had been thrown onshore ... up to two halberds [~4 m] aboye the lake level. ... Small islands and shoals had disappeared,"" (p. 883) as did ""entire houses with sleeping people"" (Cysat, 1601, p. 887). In Lucerne, the cyclic oscillation of lake level (seiche) had a period of 10 min and an estimated amplitude of 1-2 m (Cysat, 1601; Siegenthaler et al., 1987). An earthquake of this magnitude could not have directly caused such massive water movements that lasted several hours. In fact, Siegenthaler et al. (1987) linked these large-scale water movements of A.D. 1601 to two large slump deposits in the subsurface of Lake Lucerne."

September 16, 1952 - March 25, 1953. There was a multiple eruption of the Miyejin submarine volcano (31 deg 56.7 min N., 140 deg 0.5 min E.) 130 km south of Hachijo Island. The augite-hypersthene-dacite composition of the lavas determined the explosive nature of the eruptions. All the explosions were well recorded by the hydrophones of the American SOFAR system, including those on the coast of California. Some of the eruptions were observed visually from ships and airplanes by Japanese specialists. Thus, during the weak eruption of September 23 at 13h 40m, a water dome, with protuberances 600-800 m high and 2 km in diameter, arose over the volcano. No seaquake was felt, but waves 50 m long and 2 m high spread over the sea surface. During the stronger eruptions weak tsunamis were generated, 52 of which were registered by the tide gauge on Hachijo Island. The strongest of these waves were also registered by tide gauges on Jogashima Island and Cape
Omae on the south coast of Japan. The travel time of the waves to Hachijo Island was about 30 minutes, the period 1.5 minutes, the height 10-90 cm. In the nature of dispersion and other parameters, the waves corresponded to theoretical Cauchy-Poisson waves from an initial impulse with a source diameter of 2 <U>+</u> km. Some waves were like pulses. This was apparently due to the interference of waves bending around both sides of Aoga-shima Island, midway between the volcano and Hachijo Island.

<p>
Underwater slopes in fjords and inlets commonly attain a delicate equilibrium with the long-term ambient marine conditions associated with wave, current and tidal regimes, and the rate and character of sedimentation. This stability can be disrupted, leading to failure, by events or conditions that depart significantly from ambient conditions, Landslides, slumps and rock falls are often the secondary effects of earthquakes.

<p>
According to Johns et al., [ 19851, a slide event was believed to have taken place on October 17, 1974,
but its evidence was only circumstantial. A sea-surface wave reached approximately 2.4 m high, it was observed in the head of the inlet at 11:05 A.M. (LT), shortly after extreme low tide. The location of the seafloor sediment movement that might have caused this smaller wave was not determined. It is possible, however, that this event was related to the formation of a chute on the delta front/sidewall on the eastern side of the inlet. At this location, there was a chute that originated in a steeply sloping area at the intersection of the delta front, the inlet sidewall, and a distal part of a small fan delta near Kitimat Village."

<P>1963, October 9. The landslide and flood at Vaiont Reservoir in northeast Italy is a famous engineering disaster caused by the failure to manage the effects of reservoir filling upon the stability of Monte Toc, just to the south. The disaster was unusual in that dam collapse did not trigger the ensuing flood. Rather, a catastrophic landslip from the slope of Monte Toc pushed ~1/5 of the water in the newly created reservoir overtop and around the dam.

<P>1963, October 9. At 22:39 a huge landslide of about 270 million m<sup>3</sup> slid from Mount Toc into the Vajont artificial reservoir, in north-eastern Italy. The amount of water in the basin at that moment was about 115 million m<sup>3</sup>. The resulting displacement of water caused the generation of an impulse wave that spread throughout the basin. Its impressive wave run-up on the north slope of the lake, in front of Mount Toc, reached and <b>damaged buildings located in Casso</b> about 235 m over the original height of the lake surface. The resulting wave rundown crashed into the front of the landslide and partially crossed over the slide bulk, reaching the depressions behind the slide.

<P>During the whole event several impulse waves crested the dam or moved onto the surrounding slopes which became a way for the water to move out into the narrow canyon that connects the dam to the Piave Valley.

This ""wind"", propagating at a speed greater than the waterfront, preceded the waterfront and produced the first damage in Longarone, before the water reached the town. The villages located along the Piave riverbed were completely devastated and turned into a flat plain of mud, with about 1700 casualties. The wave travelled upstream for about 5 km and in the downstream cross-sections of Ponte nelle Alpi and Belluno (located respectively at about 11 and 19 km from Longarone) the estimated maximum flow was 20% - 50% higher than the one observed during the famous 1966 flood wave.

<P>On February 19, 2015 at 13:18 Universal time (February 19, 2015 at 00:18 local time), a powerful earthquake occurred offshore Northeast Paama and off north of Lopevi [Figure 12]. The Vanuatu Meteorology and Geohazards Department reported a magnitude of Ms 6.0 for the event and at a shallow depth of 10.0 km. No tsunami advisory or warning was issued for this event since the earthquake magnitude is below the threshold of magnitude 7.5 as per the Vanuatu Meteorology and Geohazards Forecast Section Standard Operating Procedures. Thus, no warning was issued for this event. It is the third known back-arc event that has generated a local tsunami; others being the 1999 Baie Martelli event and the 2012 Southeast Erromango event. A local tsunami struck the northern part of Paama and possibly Lopevi and Southeast Ambrym. Sea water receding c. 8 - 10 minutes after mainshock (eyewitnesses at Cave beach, Liro Nessa). Cobbles rattles (sea water receding) then soon after roaring sound. Most people in the village heard roaring sound. The tsunami event involves 3 waves (eyewitnesses); the first after c. 10-12 minutes after mainshock, the second wave is much bigger than first wave after c. 8-10 minutes after 1st wave and the last wave after c. 10 minutes later. The odd hour and tidal condition has much effect on tsunami impact. The tsunami struck at an abnormally low tide condition thus having huge impact on runups and inundation distances. Some preliminary observations of runup heights and inundation distances were made for coastlines of north and northwest Paama [Figure 13]. Runup heights of up to at least c. 8.0 m (inferred above low tide level at time of tsunami attack) and a maximum inundation distance of c. 150 m (inferred from low water level at time of tsunami attack). In some localities cobbles/boulders and beach sea oaks help protect the coastline. (reference #12086)
<P>Tsunami runup heights, inundation heights and distances are high on the Northwest of the island, from Tavie to Liro Nessa. A tsunami flow depth of up to 2.0 m and a runup height of at least 6.0 m were measured [Figure 8]. Inundation distances of up to 120 m were observed on Northwest Paama. The tsunami struck at a time of abnormally very low tide conditions; lowest tide for the month of February 2015. (reference 12087)"

Eight cities were destroyed, the worst hit--Patrae, Naupactus, Chaeronea and Coronea, which were destroyed, with loss of life.
<P>Procopius's contemporary and only account of these events in 551 says that at this time a (series) earthquakes occurred throughout Greece, affecting both Boeotia and Achaea and the country around the Crisean Gulf, as a result of which many towns and 8 cities, which are not named, were leveled to the ground, among which were Chaeronea, Coronea, Patrae and all of Naupactuc where there was also great loss of life... It goes on to say that, at Echinus and at Scarphea in Boeotia in the Gulf between Thessaly and Boetia, there was a sudden inlux of the sea, which leveled both towns. The sea flooded the mainland for a long time, so that for a very considerable period it was possible for men to walk to the islands, which are inside this gulf, since the sea had abandoned its proper place and spread over the land as far as the mountains. When the sea returned to its proper place, fish were left on the ground.
<P>
It is important to recognize that Procopius places earthquakes in the plural, in the context of more than one earthquake in more than one place... he clearly refers to more than one, probably three, distinct earthquakes in central Greece, that is (1) a destructive shock in Boeotia that caused great loss of life in Schisma and destroyed Coronea and Chaeronea, probably damaging Corinth; (2) <b>a destructive sea wave at Echinus and Scarpheia</B>, which was probably associated with a second earthquake about 70 km away in the Maliakos Gulf between Thessaly and Boettia; and (3) a damaging shock more than 100 km to the west of Schisma in the Gulf of Corinth and in Achaea, which heavily damaged Nafpaktos and Patra.

The estimated 200 million metric tons of rock spilled onto the toe of Tyndall Glacier and into Taan Fjord, in Icy Bay, Alaska. This landslide produced a tsunami that was recorded at two NOS tide gages monitored by the National Tsunami Warning Center (NTWC). (reference #11514)
<P>An approximately 100-m high landslide generated tsunami flooded the coastline of Taan Fiord in SW Alaska on October 17, 2015. Inundation reached 190 m at its highest point, and exceeded 50 m along over 10 km of coastline. Within the area of inundation, several alluvial fans provided both a source and depositional setting for sediment transported by the tsunami, and each fan is blanketed by tens of cm to meters of sediment. During a month of fieldwork in spring and summer of 2016, we sampled and documented these deposits. Where the wave was largest near the tsunami source, the deposit has two distinct layers: A) a basal layer with very poorly sorted sediment ranging from sand to boulders and B) an overlying layer composed of relatively well sorted cobbles and boulders where interstitial spaces are open except at the base of this layer, where they are packed with sand. Flattened vegetation at the base of layer A indicates the lower deposit formed during inrush. Channeling and small fan-like features in layer B suggest it formed during tsunami return flow. Farther towards the mouth of the fjord, where the tsunami was only a fraction of the initial height, two fans preserve a similar poorly sorted basal layer that was in many places overlain with boulders and/or sand. The thickness of the deposit and its consistency across multiple fans along the fjord suggest both that similar deposits could be indicators of paleo landslide-generated tsunamis, and that deposit stratigraphy from these kinds of events may record useful information about a tsunamiÂ’s size and character. (reference #11717)
<P>On 17 October 2015, an estimated 60 Ã— 106m3 rockmass (Haeussler et al., 2017; Higman et al., submitted for publication) detached from as high as ~850 m above sea level at the terminus of Tyndall Glacier (Figs. 1, 3), a site of previous landsliding (Meigs et al., 2006). Approximately 90% of the mass entered directly into the fjord, creating a tsunami with runup of up to 192 m (Higman et al., submitted for publication). Some debris re-emerged from the fjord on the opposite shore of Taan Fiord and on the eastern moraine, where it formed hummocky deposits typical of large landslides. Such re-emergence of debris onto land after travel throughwater has, to our knowledge, not been described before. A small portion of the landslide debris (~3%) slid onto Tyndall Glacier and a larger slide block remained within the source area (~7%). (reference #12007)
<P>Glacial retreat in recent decades has exposed unstable slopes and allowed deep water to extend beneath some of those slopes. Slope failure at the terminus of Tyndall Glacier on 17 October 2015 sent 180 million tons of rock into Taan Fiord, Alaska.

According to Oceanographic Institute of the Navy, INOCAR, the crest of the tsunami wave arrived to the city of Esmeraldas 6 minutes after the earthquake. This is a very short time for the tsunami travel time from the tsunami landslides scars proposed by Ratzov et al, 2007, and also for the fault plane for the similar 1942 earthquake, as it is demonstrated in Ioualalen et al, 2011. Using both numerical simulation, the tsunami would have arrived more than 20 minutes from its generation zones. For the case of seismically-induced tsunami, we would need to update the numerical simulation when the focal mechanism is well defined.
<P>Several people at the coastal communities reported remarkable changes in the seawater level and also
strong rift currents, although the amplitude of the tsunami did not reach any high water level.Fortunately for these coastal communities, the tsunami impact occurred at low tide. This important fact appears to be the reason that no inundation occurred and considerable physical effects at the coastalines have been absent. However, this case could have been catastrophic under different tide conditions. It should be noted that some of the authorities were not alerted for a tsunami hazard due to the false perception that a tsunami would not be possible because the epicenter in the continental and not on the marine side.

The only historical tsunami is associated with the 12 March 1993, MW 6.4 earthquake that caused &#8764;0.5 m uplift of the reef along the southern coast of Futuna (Regnier, 1994). A small tsunami was reported along Futuna's south coast but no further observations of the wave were noted (Monzier et al., 1993; Capecchi, 1995). Immediate post-1993 earthquake studies focused on the extensive damage caused by the event including the destruction of every church greater than 100 years old. An earlier earthquake in 1840, with strong ground shaking and intense building damage, was described by the missionary station of St Pierre Chanel, but no tsunami was noted. In addition to historical records, some oral traditions provide tantalising evidence of prehistoric events that may have been catastrophic tsunamis, but age estimates are unclear (Di Piazza and Frimigacci, 1991). While sparse, the data discussed above indicate that the tsunami hazard is real, and the risk for the population who live almost exclusively along the low-lying coast is high. (reference #6956)
<P>The shock was followed by a small tidal wave, localized at  Leava Bay, which caused extensive damage on boats who were there. On this subject, it is noted the authorities broadcasted by radio shortly after the start of the crisis, a message advising people to climb the mountain following the strong earthquake. The Futunians have fully complied with this instruction, fleeing the high part of the island after the earthquake of 13 March (the message being broadcast only Futunan, Europeans were generally not in present and therefore do not respond ...). Although in this case no significant tidal wave happened this evacuation along the coastal plain is be considered still valid in the event of strong shaking (it is not needed to stay more than 1 or 2 hours in the mountains, the tidal wave, in this case, having a local origin and thus occurring a few minutes after the earthquake).

In northern Taiwan, a tsunami in AD 1754 has been reported and appears to be coeval with the lower quartzose sandy layer at the boundary between the 17th and 18th centuries (Hsu, 1971; Iida, 1984; Lau et al., 2010; Soloviev and Go, 1974; Yang, 1987).

1694 by 60 years, due to the sexagenary cycle that was adopted in Taiwan's early history</B> (Fang, 1969; Hsu, 1983; Yu, 1698). Similar to the AD 1867 earthquake, the AD 1694 earthquake was also related to the Shanchiao Fault, and resulted in metres of hanging wall subsidence in Taipei, southwest of Jinshan (Hsu, 1983; Lai et al., 2010).
<P>The AD 1694 earthquake could be correlated to the lower event layer between the 14thÂ–17th century deposits and the 18th century deposits.

At each recoil of this tremendous surf the whole space between the channel further than Blockade was laid nearly bare, so as to discover frightful rocks and fragments, that before had never been visible. The water dashed against the barrack pale, & at the next returned reached to their very top, in one dreadful mass threatening destruction to the whole town; and our fears suggested, that had it then broke upon us its fury must have been irresistible: this happily was not the case, though many houses were much damaged, and one swept totally away. This rage of the element continued the whole night; nor did the tide recover its usual flow until the third day following. Between us and the Little Island many rocks appeared at intervals which had ever before been secreted from the eye by a depth of water. In Pigrun Bay, from the exposed situation of which such a rapid surf would be less unaccountable, no difference was visible, nor was any part of the Island, to the eastward of Far Bay, at all affected, tho' an easterly wind prevailed almost the whole time.""

It continued thus, with little abatement, until one in the morning of the 12th, when happily the consternation was removed with its cause; but during the continuance of which every building within the possible reach of the exasperated element was emptied of its contents.

<P>In the month of May, 1805, Norfolk Island experienced a considerable influx of the sea, which, from the extraordinary nature of the occurrence, is worthy of mention. The tide first ebbed to a great distance; when, suddenly, an unusual swell was seen coming in, which occasioned considerable alarm to the colony, to whom such a circumstance was entirely novel: it rose to a great height, and retired to its channel. A second time it revisited the shore, and flowed to a more considerable height than before: a second time it retreated; and once again returned, with a fury surpassing its former efforts; paralyzing the spectators with terror, who were unable to imagine where the extraordinary swellings might pause. For the last time, however, the ocean left the shores, without having caused any material damage; and, in its regress, it opened the secrets of the deep, and displayed to ""mortal ken"" rocks which had remained until now undiscovered.

<P>In contrast with the Tongoa experience, however, was that of about the only European settler in the Santa Cruz group, Mr. A. E. C. Forrest.

As the group is comparatively seldom called at by passing vessels news rarely reaches Sydney from there; but the Ysabel pays Mr. Forrest's station a visit about four times a year.  She was there nearly three months ago and will return on her next outward trip from Sydney about a week hence. Mr. Forrest has written to Mr. Mitchell, of Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Co. an account of a phenomenal experience he had in the <B>latter part of March</B>. It was a sudden outbreak of a volcano, which was followed by an overwhelming tidal wave.  Santa Cruz Islands, seven in number, are notable as being the scene of the disastrous loss of the two ships Boussole and Astrola, of La Perouse, in 1788, an event which was not ascertained with any certainty until May, 1826, or 38 years afterwards. Santa Cruz Island [Nendo Island], on which Mr. Forrest resides, is the principal of the group, and it was here that natives attacked the boats of H.M.S. Pearl, under Commodore Goodenough, in August, 1875, and with their poisoned arrows fatally wounded the much respected Commodore. Mr. Forrest describes how the volcano burst forth with smoke and flame, emitting ashes, and all but ruining his plantations. At night there was a fearful roar out to seaward, and soon after a huge sea broke on the coast, smashing his trading craft into splinters, washing away the copra-house and demolishing his store of copra and cocoanuts, completing in fact the work of destruction left unfinished by the seismic disturbance. At the time of writing Mr. Forrest was not informed of what loss of life inland amongst the natives as a result of the eruption had taken place or what the effect of the tidal wave had elsewhere been on the Santa Cruz coast, but he fears, as the island is thickly populated, some fatalities have happened. The group is a volcanic one, and before contained an active volcano upon an uninhabited island not far from Santa Cruz. (reference #11695)"

The distance from where the debris went into the sea across the bay to where the wave struck is not less than half a mile, and it is said that some of the rocks lifted by its force and hurled across the road are over 200 pounds in weight.

Three days before, or at 40 minutes past 10 a.m. on September 24, the tide-gauge in Sydney harbour recorded the fact that the water suddenly receded from this coast after the manner of earthquake waves, and in a few minutes began to return, reaching the crest in 30 minutes.

Speaking to Tasnim on Tuesday morning, Mohammad Hassan Basti, a deputy to governor of IranÂ’s southern province of Bushehr, said the body of an eight-year-old boy was retrieved from the pier of Dayyer on Monday evening. He was the second victim among a total of six people lost in the deadly sea storm and subsequent flooding that hit Dayyer on Sunday, he noted. According to Basti, 22 people have been wounded in the incident, 80 dwellings have been destroyed, urban infrastructure has been damaged, and some 200 boats have been wrecked in the natural disaster. Head of BushehrÂ’s Persian Gulf Oceanography Centre Ehsan Abedi had announced that the reason behind the giant waves and the sea overflow was a natural phenomenon called Seiche, saying it occurs when strong winds push water and cause water levels to drop at one end and rise at the other.

It resulted in one death and five people missing, and reportedly capsized about 300 boats and caused ~$10 million of damage.

The death of one woman was reported in 2 entries with reference made to Â“Taiwan interview catalogueÂ” (Chen et al., 1830). In contrast, Yang (1987) recorded >50 000 deaths associated with a tsunami caused by a Taiwan Strait earthquake in May. In citing >50 000 deaths Yang also quoted descriptions from Chen et al. (1830). The death toll reported for this event appears erroneous since it is not cited in the detailed publications of Soloviev and Go (1974), and Zhou and Adam (1986). However, the inclusion of the 1781 tsunami-like event into the work of Yang (1987) has been generally accepted and this Â“deadlyÂ” tsunami report is now widely quoted among Chinese literatures (e.g. Wang and Bao, 1992; Ye et al., 2005). <P>The Yang (1987) record of the 1781 April-June event (#14) is possibly the best example of how erroneous reporting can arise when including information from previous publications.

The descriptions are similar to those for the 22 May 1782 event (#15) recorded for Taiwan by Iida et al. (1967) and Soloviev and Go (1974).

Not only did the seismic waves last for approximately five minutes, but they were monochromatic and slowly increased in amplitude (the highest amplitude waves lasted about 30 seconds). Such traits, according to the IRIS blog, authored by John Clinton (ETH Zurich), Tine Larsen, Trine Dahl-Jensen, Peter Voss (GEUS Copenhagen), and Meredith Nettles (Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University) are Â“indicative of complex landslide signals.Â” (ref #11836)
<P>The team, including the acclaimed environmental scientist Hermann Fritz, has estimated that the wave at the coast where the landslide struck reached a marked 90 meters altitude. It is more than twice as high as the Round Tower. On the opposite side of the fjord, the height according to the researchers was 50 meters. (ref #11854)

The upper extent of the release area was at over 1200- m elevation, and the main body of the rock avalanche source was 800 m across and reached over 300-m thickness in places. (ref #11994)

Differential digital elevation models (DEMs) estimate a landslide volume of 35Â–51 million cubic meters. The landslide triggered a tsunami that washed up in a remote region near the village of Nuugaatsiaq, reportedly killing four people, injuring dozens, and washing away eleven homes (Bessette-Kirton et al., 2017).

In Laucala Bay waters the amplitude, measured from crest to trough, may have been about 0.5 m (i.e. the order of half the tidal range) because sand banks appeared and disappeared and the change in level on the barrier reef was sufficient to have a noticeable effect on appearance of the ocean waves breaking on the reef edge, according to reliable observers at the MRD office which is about 2 km from Laucala Bay shoreline and 8 km from the reef bounding the seaward side of the bay (Fig. 3). Unfortunately the only available tide-gauge data in Suva are smoothed 15-minute mean plots and mean hourly values of the Suva Harbour sea level. These data 'effectively smooth out the tsunami waves and a tsunami in Suva Harbour could not be detected. The occurrence of the waves is of particular interest because earthquakes with such a small magnitude do not generally cause tsunamis (Iida, 1970). The tsunami was probably generated by a minor submarine slump caused by the shaking (intensity MM 4-5) in the Suva-Beqa outer reef zone in a manner similar to that of the 1953 tsunami (Everingham, 1983b), which illustrates .the ease with which a slump can be initiated.

<P>Mr. John Brown, Snohomish, of Sandy Point added some other details. Old Indians told him the slide was an overhang, and the fall buried hundreds who were clamming there. The wave washed over to Hat Island and drowned hundreds who ere clamming there. 
<P>...it is pointed out that the naming of known recent historical persons of one's own family gives a historical basis that cannot lightly be dismissed. The story would indicate a date of 1820-1830 for the incident.
<P>The numbers given by John Brown could be exaggerations, but it is certain that the clam beds at Camano Head and the northern end of Hat Island always have been the most important beds in the Snohomish area. Hence, being early on summer morning before the people were all up, the casualties may indeed have been very heavy, even running into hundreds, especially at the Head itself from which there was no escape.

No mention is made of the wave at other low-lying sites in the vicinity, such as Sandy Point on Whidbey Island - the closest barrier beach and marsh to Camano Head.
<P>Although the accounts leave many questions unanswered, the following seems fairly clear. Early on a summer morning in the early 1800s, a large landslide occurred at Camano Head, carrying standing trees to the beach, and burying many people living at the toe of the bluff. The landslide sounded like thunder and created large volumes of dust. The landslide also resulted in a tsunami that traveled south toward Hat Island, washing over the barrier beach, destroying houses or encampments and drowning many people.
<P>The accounts make no mention of ground shaking, suggesting that the landslide was not associated with a major earthquake.
<P>The Camano Head landslide is the only known example of a landslide on Puget Sound generating a tsunami large enough to cause significant loss of life.
<P><P><blockquote><i>Reference #11942:</i></blockquote> 
<P>One of the Snohomish villages was located beneath a bluff at the southern tip of Camano Island, Camano Head.

One early summer day, just as first dawn was beginning to lighten the eastern sky, that village was destroyed. <P>A sound like thunder awakened the families living in the village across the water on the northwestern shore of Hat Island -- perhaps also the people at Hebolb, the major village in north Everett.

<P>At 3.10pm local time (2:10 am UTC) there was an earthquake of about M6 about 200km south of Raoul Island in the Kermadecs, and over the next 2-3 hours there were unusual waves recorded on the Raoul Island and North Island tide gauges (see attachment). The wave periods are about 5 minutes, and the peak-to-trough amplitude is up to about a metre on Raoul Island and up to about half a metre on the North Island gauges. A reverse travel-time analysis seems to confirm that the source of the waves was coincident with the time and location of the earthquake. The amplitudes are large for an M6 earthquake, and it does not appear to be a slow Â‘tsunami earthquakeÂ’. The location is on the Kermadec seamount ridge so a volcanic or landslide source are possibilities. 
<P>Most interesting is that the moment tensor solution is highly isotropic, which would be typical of an explosive source. So perhaps a volcanic event?

The tsunami may imply a vertical component in the motion of the ocean floor or else it possibly was caused by a submarine landslide.

<P>The most important results of the field survey were the fine (up to 1-m) resolution DEM of the landslide and the nearby area and the instrumental measurements of run-ups and inundation distances of the resulted water wave. In total, about 50 measurements were made. The maximum run-up reached at the bank of the Sredniy Sandar river (actually, a creek flowing from north into the Bureya river just near the landslide), turned out to be equal to 90 meters. With this value, the December 11, 2018 Bureya tsunami shares with the June 17, 2017 Greenland tsunami the seventh-eighth places in the global list of the largest tsunamis of the landslide origin, having instrumental measurements of this parameter.
<P>The maximum penetration of the water wave along the valley of the Srendiy Sandar river was 3.75 km, the water stopped at an altitude of 78 m above the undisturbed water level at the time of the event. There the wave left a pile of tree trunks up to 2 meter in heght.  The maximum run-up reached by the wave on the gentle slope of &#8203;&#8203;the right (northern) bank, faced directly to the landslide, was  up to 55-60 meters, with an inundation distance up to 650 meters from the water edge. All the trees and soil cover in this area were completely removed. The height of the mound of broken trees left at the inundation limit in this area  reaches 5 meters.
<P>The run-ups on the left (southern) slopes, at a distance of up to one kilometer from the landslide, were within 35-45 meters in upstream direction, and within of 25-35 meters in the downstream direction.
<P>In the field survey, it was found that the actual run-ups were by 5-10 (sometimes up to 15) meters higher the trim line of complete destruction of the forest and soil cover, visible in air photos and satellite images of the affected area."

According to the information from coastal resident community, during a fine day, waves with height of 2 m to 3 m attacked the coast several times, damaged house walls and trees near the coast. To confirm the possibility of the tsunami at the coast, the first author of this report did a survey at the coast during March, 2008. It was found during the survey that waves only caused inundation in a very narrow area, with the largest inundation distance of several ten meters from the water line. Also, infiltrated waves dissipated onshore very rapidly. By comparing damage by the waves with damage by a typical tsunami with the same height (such as the tsunami in West Java July, 2006), it can be remarked that it is difficult to conclude that the above mentioned waves are tsunami. The waves might be wind waves in combination with wave/wind setup and high flood tide. (reference #12499)"

The event happened during a fine day, when waves with the height of half bamboo tree height (more than 3m) attacked the coast of Dien Chau, North Central Vietnam (Figure 1). The waves caused inundation with maximum inundation distance of more than 1km from the coast and the inundation depth of more than 1.5m. The waves damaged many houses, but it was uncertain how many people were killed. The examination of all earthquakes in the SCS during the period from 1880 to 1920 shows no earthquake that could generate significant tsunami at the Vietnamese coast. Thus, Nguyen Dinh Xuyen (2007) suggested that the waves might be generated by submarine landslide. (reference #12499)"

However, the investigation by a team from Center for Marine and Ocean-Atmosphere Interaction Research found no documents showing the tsunami event. On the other hand, the second author of this report did a survey at Binh Thuan Province coast (including Mui Ne in Figure 1) by interviewing old local residents.

<P>The oldest [sic] is given to us in Roberts's Journal. This English adventurer stayed in the Marquesas archipelago from 1798 to 1806 and married a daughter of a chief to Nuku Hiva, who allowed him to integrate with the Marquesan society. What is said here confirms the end of the preceding paragraph: de Cato, and some others have informed me that the sea, several times in the course of time, has risen four or five feet above its normal level, and has come rolling. in a heavy wave through the grass and bushes. It remained for a short time, and then suddenly retreated, leaving a good quantity of fish through the grass and bushes ... These sudden overflows of the sea occurred twenty or thirty years ago. This, I think, is very singular because I had never heard that the sea could rise so suddenly in any part of the world. (Demming page 242)
<P>Robarts having left the archipelago in 1806, it can be supposed that it was after his departure that a tsunami occurred which destroyed the bread trees and the food resources of the low valleys at Nuku Hiva. Encouraging people to attempt a last migration or nearly eight hundred people disappeared in pursuit of the setting sun. Dr. Rollin located this catastrophe between 1804 and 1806. (Rollin, 231)
